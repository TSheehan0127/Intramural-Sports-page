# Intramural Sports Page
A basic website created to learn Flask and apply full-stack web development skills in one project.

## About
This project was originally developed for my Database Systems class with my partner, Matthew Clark. We used Python and SQLite to create a terminal-based application. I am now restarting the project with the goal of building a Flask-based web app, complete with a front end using HTML and CSS.

The intramural sports page serves as a hub where users can join local sporting events. It will allow users to create teams, leave events, and browse other sports of interest.

For the original version, we used AI to generate sample data including team names, users, and events. In this new version, I plan to add significant functionality, such as tracking live scores and implementing a stats tracker for each event. The entire project will be rebuilt from the ground up, except for the pre-generated sample data.

## Goals
Through this project, I hope to gain practical experience working with both the front end and back end of a web application. As I continue learning JavaScript, I eventually plan to transition the backend to Node.js in the future.
